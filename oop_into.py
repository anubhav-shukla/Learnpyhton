# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

# class ,object(instance) ,method

# in python everything is a object

# list class #class is a blueprint [] 
# list object  #l2,l,l3
# method  #append 

# in class we decide how look like our object

l=[1,2,3,4]  #l,l2,l3 are an object
l2=[4,5,6,7]  #class is define how they look like list '[]' square bracket
l3=['Anubhav ','Shukla'] #[] means list , when you use [] ,it means a list
l.append(8)  #because it is predefined in python

# hope class ,object and method is clear
