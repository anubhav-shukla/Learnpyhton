# like  before we see in the other chapter see here how can use loop and  some  other thing in set\\
# python more_about_set.py
s={'a','b','c','d','e','f'}

# in keyword in set and for loop

# we check here item is present or not  in the list

if 'a' in s:
    print('present')
else:    
    print('not present')    

# hope it clear


#  noe see for loop
for item in s:
    print(item) #it print all element that are in set
    # *** here it print in order 

    #For remove duplication we use  list
    #
    #set math
    # 
s1={1,2,4,5,6}
s2={3,4,7,8,9,10}
# two operation in set that are match with math
# union 
# intersection

# union(|) 

unionset=s1|s2
print(unionset) #see it  combine all 
# remember it print only unique item

#intersection (&)
print(s1&s2) #it only that element is match
# output is onlt 4

# hope  these concept is clear

# after this we learn pythonion after it
